# MVP Build Checklist

Derived from [`docs/MVP_Build_Plan_EN.md`](docs/MVP_Build_Plan_EN.md). Every acceptance criterion
below is quoted from that plan or from the decision it implements — this file tracks progress, it
does not create requirements. If a box here disagrees with the build plan, the build plan wins.

**Legend** — `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done and verified

---

## Phase 0 — Week Zero (before any code)

### Mandatory prototypes

- [x] **P-01 — Arabic PDF** · risk `R-02`
  - [x] Full Arabic paragraph renders with correct shaping, no broken glyphs
  - [x] Item table renders correctly
  - [x] Numbers render correctly and are not reversed in RTL
  - [x] Fonts are embedded, not referenced from the OS
  - [x] Verified visually, not merely produced
- [ ] **P-02 — Deploy to the real server**
  - [ ] Hello page runs on the on-premise server
  - [ ] Page opens from a phone over VPN
  - [ ] Fonts render correctly on the Linux server (not just macOS)

> No module begins until both prototypes pass.

### Sign-off — required before writing code 🔴

- [ ] **OD-01** — Are additional items taxable? *(assumption: yes)* — **Accountant**
- [ ] **OD-03** — Server specifications — **Server administrator**
- [ ] **VAT ordering** — is VAT charged before or after the discount? The company's PO charges it on
      the pre-discount amount; `§5.2` discounts first. Different tax base. — **Accountant**
- [ ] Stack decision (Laravel) recorded as a new decision in `§2`

### Required during the build 🟡

- [ ] **OD-02** — PDF template *(before Module 9 — effectively answered by P-01, needs confirmation)*
- [ ] **OD-04** — VPN type and concurrent capacity *(before Module 12)*
- [ ] **OD-06** — Company holiday calendar *(before Module 13)*
- [ ] **OD-05** — Expected daily workload *(queue and storage sizing)*

### One-time documents

- [x] Functional and non-functional requirements
- [x] Architecture document
- [x] Permission matrix
- [x] User personas — 8 roles
- [x] Design system
- [x] OpenAPI contract
- [ ] Arabic companions: `CRM_Documentation.md`, `MVP_Build_Plan.md`, `Design_System_AR.md`,
      `OpenAPI_Contract_AR.md`, `Documentation_Map_AR.md`

---

## Definition of done — applies to every module

Copy this block per module. A module is not complete until all seven pass.

- [ ] All acceptance criteria pass
- [ ] Permission checks enforced at the API, not just the UI
- [ ] Audit log records this module's operations
- [ ] Loading / empty / error states on every screen
- [ ] Screen works in both RTL and LTR
- [ ] Migration runs and reverses cleanly (up + down)
- [ ] Deployed to the server and the smoke test passes

---

## Module 0 — Foundation

*Infrastructure — no user story.*

- [ ] Project structure (backend + frontend)
- [ ] Database connection + migration tooling
- [ ] **i18n layer from day one** — no hard-coded strings, Arabic + English
- [ ] Design system + base RTL/LTR layout
- [ ] Storage abstraction layer + `files` table
- [ ] **Audit log as a cross-cutting layer** — automatic for every later module
- [ ] Queue + jobs infrastructure — four queues: `critical` · `pdf` · `reports` · `maintenance`
- [ ] Seed data — roles · permissions · sectors · units · currencies · test users

**Tests**
- [ ] App runs · frontend talks to backend · database connects
- [ ] Switching language flips direction
- [ ] A test job executes from the queue

---

## Module 1 — Identity & Permissions (Dynamic RBAC)

> As a team member, I want to log in with my email and password, so that I can access the system
> with my role's permissions.

- [ ] Product with no recorded price → **save is blocked**
- [ ] Supplier price changed after the quotation was built (Draft) → warning + "refresh prices"
- [ ] Employee and Team Leader edit simultaneously → **409 Conflict**

**Money rules — no exceptions**
- [ ] `Decimal` everywhere; no float touches a price
- [ ] All calculations in the backend
- [ ] No intermediate rounding — final total only

- [ ] Arabic renders correctly with embedded fonts *(proven by P-01)*
- [ ] Rendering consumes a customer-view model that **structurally cannot** contain supplier,
      cost, or margin fields

---

## Module 10 — Customer Response & Purchase Orders

> As a sales employee, I want to record the customer's response, so that the deal moves along the
> correct path.

**Tables** `purchase_orders` — auto `po_number` + free-text `customer_po_reference` + date + attachment

**Acceptance criteria**

## After all modules

### End-to-end testing
- [ ] Full journey: Lead → Contacted → RFQ → supplier offer → customer quotation → approval → PDF →
      purchase order → procurement → delivery
- [ ] Parallel journey: one customer with two concurrent deals — confirm the separation holds
- [ ] **Restart test:** power the server down and back up → all services return on their own and
      missed jobs run

### Final server setup
- [ ] PostgreSQL + Redis + Meilisearch on the server
- [ ] Nginx reverse proxy + SSL
- [ ] Process manager, **enabled on boot**, correct order:
      PostgreSQL → Redis → Meilisearch → application → workers → Nginx
- [ ] `/health` endpoint reporting each service explicitly
- [ ] **Daily backups: database + files + Meilisearch — on a separate machine/disk**
- [ ] **A real restore test** — not just confirming the file exists
- [ ] **External heartbeat monitoring** (a down server cannot report itself down)
- [ ] Runbooks: restore · startup · deployment · rollback

### Pilot rollout
- [ ] Import legacy data from Excel + a session to complete incomplete records
- [ ] User training — one session per role
- [ ] **Two weeks running in parallel** with the current process before full cutover

## MVP success criteria

**Primary:** 80% of quotations produced in the system within one month of go-live.

| Criterion | Target | Measured from | Met |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quotations produced in the system | ≥ 80% | System count ÷ actual count | [ ] |
| Active customers registered | 100% | Review with the Team Leader | [ ] |
| Daily reports submitted | ≥ 70% of working days | Reports table | [ ] |
| Outdoor visits logged from mobile | ≥ 80% | Visits table | [ ] |
| Average quotation approval time | ≤ 1 working day | Quotation timeline | [ ] |
| Open critical bugs | Zero | Error centre | [ ] |
| Unplanned downtime | Zero | System health | [ ] |

Missing the criterion is not failure — it is a prompt to find the **cause**. The next step follows
from the cause, not from adding features.
