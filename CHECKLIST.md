# MVP Build Checklist

Derived from [`docs/MVP_Build_Plan_EN.md`](docs/MVP_Build_Plan_EN.md). Every acceptance criterion
below is quoted from that plan or from the decision it implements — this file tracks progress, it
does not create requirements. If a box here disagrees with the build plan, the build plan wins.

**Legend** — `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done and verified

---

## Phase 0 — Week Zero (before any code)

### Mandatory prototypes

- [x] **P-01 — Arabic PDF** · risk `R-02`
  - [x] Full Arabic paragraph renders with correct shaping, no broken glyphs
  - [x] Item table renders correctly
  - [x] Numbers render correctly and are not reversed in RTL
  - [x] Fonts are embedded, not referenced from the OS
  - [x] Verified visually, not merely produced
- [ ] **P-02 — Deploy to the real server** · ⏸ **deferred under `D-66`**, not cancelled
  - [ ] Hello page runs on the on-premise server
  - [ ] Page opens from a phone over Cloudflare Tunnel + Access (D-59)
  - [ ] Fonts render correctly on the Linux server (not just macOS)

> P-01 has passed. `P-02` waits for the server; development runs on a production-matched Docker
> environment in the meantime (`D-66`). `P-02` must still pass before the pilot rollout.

### Sign-off — required before writing code 🔴

- [x] **OD-01** — Are additional items taxable? **No** — delivery and installation are outside the tax
      base (`D-62`, confirmed 2026-08-19)
- [ ] **OD-03** — Server specifications — **Server administrator** · no longer blocks the start of
      development (`D-66`); still blocks the server, `P-02`, and everything on the deployment-debt list
- [x] **VAT ordering** — tax is calculated **after** the discount (`D-64`, confirmed 2026-08-19).
      Supersedes `D-60`; the company's PO #226 is no longer a reconciliation target for tax ordering
- [x] **Rounding** — optional per currency, can be switched off entirely (`D-65`)
- [ ] **«إشعار خصم»** — is the PO line a sale discount or a separate credit note? Still open — **Accountant**
- [x] Stack decision (Laravel) recorded as **D-57** in `§2` and `§14.2`

### Required during the build 🟡

- [ ] **OD-02** — PDF template *(before Module 9 — effectively answered by P-01, needs confirmation)*
- [x] ~~**OD-04** — VPN type and concurrent capacity~~ — closed by `D-59`: Cloudflare Tunnel + Access, 5 named users
- [ ] **OD-06** — Company holiday calendar *(before Module 13)*
- [ ] **OD-05** — Expected daily workload *(queue and storage sizing)*

### One-time documents

- [x] Functional and non-functional requirements
- [x] Architecture document
- [x] Permission matrix
- [x] User personas — 8 roles
- [x] Design system
- [x] OpenAPI contract
- [—] Arabic companions — **no longer a deliverable.** Arabic translations exist in `arabic/`
      as reading copies for the project owner only. They are not part of the system and are not
      kept in sync. Five English headers still declare them; see README open questions.

---

## Definition of done — applies to every module

Copy this block per module. A module is not complete until all seven pass.

- [ ] All acceptance criteria pass
- [ ] Permission checks enforced at the API, not just the UI
- [ ] Audit log records this module's operations
- [ ] Loading / empty / error states on every screen
- [ ] Screen works in both RTL and LTR
- [ ] Migration runs and reverses cleanly (up + down)
- [ ] Passes on the production-matched local environment, and its deployment debt is recorded (`D-66`)

> While `P-02` is deferred, the seventh item is the local environment. It reverts to "deployed to the
> server and the smoke test passes" the moment the server exists — and every module already marked done
> gets that item re-opened, not grandfathered.

---

## Deployment debt — `D-66`

Everything below is unverifiable without the real server. Nothing here counts as done until it has
actually run there. This list is the price of starting locally, and it is meant to be read before
every "are we ready to ship" conversation — not at the end.

- [ ] **P-02 itself** — hello page on the server, reachable from a phone
- [ ] **Arabic fonts on Linux** — `P-01` proved the server has none; container parity is evidence, the
      server is proof
- [ ] **Cloudflare Tunnel + Access** (`D-59`) — the whole external path, 5 named users, outbound-only
      tunnel, ≥8h Access session
- [ ] **Module 12 connection-unavailable message** — cannot be exercised without real external access
- [ ] **Boot order** `ST-01`…`ST-09` — PostgreSQL → Redis → Meilisearch → app → workers → Nginx,
      enabled on boot, health check logged
- [ ] **Missed-job catch-up on startup** (`D-55`, `ST-05`)
- [ ] **Restart recovery** (`D-54`) — power down, power up, everything returns on its own
- [ ] **Backups** `BK-01`…`BK-08` — daily set, checksums, off-server copy, and a **real restore test**
- [ ] **External heartbeat** (`OBS-07`) — a down server cannot report itself down
- [ ] **Queue and storage sizing** — blocked on `OD-03` and `OD-05`
- [ ] **Nginx + SSL, process manager, `/health` per service**
- [ ] **CPU architecture** — the local stack is `linux/arm64` (Apple Silicon); the server is almost
      certainly `linux/amd64`. Decided 2026-08-19 to continue on arm64 and switch when `OD-03`
      names the architecture. Container parity therefore covers the OS, libraries, locale and
      fonts, **but not the instruction set**. Specifically unproven until the server runs it:
      natively-compiled PHP extensions, the headless Chrome build behind Browsershot (`§14.6`),
      and any performance figure measured locally (`PRF-01`…`PRF-03` are not comparable).
      Rebuilding with `--platform linux/amd64` is the switch, at the cost of emulated build speed.
- [ ] **Image hardening** — the official `php:*-fpm-bookworm` base ships `gcc`, `make` and
      `autoconf`. Harmless in development, but a compiler inside a production container is
      avoidable attack surface. Strip it in the production image build.

## Module 0 — Foundation

*Infrastructure — no user story.*

- [ ] Project structure (backend + frontend)
- [ ] Database connection + migration tooling
- [ ] **i18n layer from day one** — no hard-coded strings, Arabic + English
- [ ] Design system + base RTL/LTR layout
- [ ] Storage abstraction layer + `files` table
- [ ] **Audit log as a cross-cutting layer** — automatic for every later module
- [ ] Queue + jobs infrastructure — four queues: `critical` · `pdf` · `reports` · `maintenance`
- [ ] Seed data — roles · permissions · sectors · units · currencies · test users

**Tests**
- [ ] App runs · frontend talks to backend · database connects
- [ ] Switching language flips direction
- [ ] A test job executes from the queue

---

## Module 1 — Identity & Permissions (Dynamic RBAC)

- [ ] Login As is Super Admin only and always writes an audit entry

🚀 **First deployment point — deploy to the real server here, not at the end.**

---

## Module 2 — Settings, Managed Lists & Currencies

> As a system administrator, I want to configure company details, currencies and lists, so that the
> system runs on the company's real data.

**Tables** `settings` · `currencies` (+ rounding unit) · `fx_rates` + history · `enum_lists` ·
`system_limits`

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] FX rate edit → old rate stays in history + mandatory audit entry

- [ ] Currency rounding unit changes → **only new quotations** are affected
- [ ] Rounding units default correctly: EGP `1` · USD `0.01` · EUR `0.01`
- [ ] Rounding can be switched **off** per currency → final total stored unrounded, `rounding_diff` = `0` (`D-65`)

---

## Module 3 — Customers

---

## Module 7 — Customer Quotations ⭐ (the hardest module)

> As a sales employee, I want to build a price quotation for my customer using supplier prices and a
> profit margin, so that I can send it after my Team Leader's approval.

**Tables** `quotations` · `quotation_items` · `quotation_additional_items` · `user_term_suggestions`

**Endpoints**
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/quotations` · `GET /:id`
- [ ] `PATCH /:id/submit-for-approval`
- [ ] `POST /:id/new-version`
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/quotations?group_by=employee|customer`

**Frontend** quotation builder — dynamic suppliers via (+) up to 10 · products per supplier · live
calculation · confirmation preview before saving · SmartTermInput

**Acceptance criteria — the most important in the project**
- [ ] Cost 1000, margin 20% → selling price **1200** automatically
- [ ] Quotation margin 20%, line margin 30% → line uses **30%**
- [ ] Suppliers in different currencies → converted at the FX rate captured at creation, one
      quotation currency
- [ ] Rounding on: total 1234.67 EGP → final total **1235**, `rounding_diff` **0.33**
- [ ] Rounding on: total 1234.678 USD → final total **1234.68** (rounding unit 0.01)
- [ ] Rounding off for the currency → final total keeps full precision, `rounding_diff` **0** (`D-65`)
- [ ] Items 10,000 + delivery 1,000, discount 1%, tax 14% → tax base **9,900**, tax **1,386**
      (discount first per `D-64`; delivery outside the base per `D-62`)
- [ ] Customer flagged tax-exempt, or `tax_percent` null → **no tax line at all**, not a zero line (`D-63`)
- [ ] Quantity above the supplier's recorded amount → **inline red warning**, not a block
- [ ] Product with no recorded price → **save is blocked**
- [ ] Supplier price changed after the quotation was built (Draft) → warning + "refresh prices"
- [ ] Employee and Team Leader edit simultaneously → **409 Conflict**

**Money rules — no exceptions**
- [ ] `Decimal` everywhere; no float touches a price
- [ ] All calculations in the backend
- [ ] No intermediate rounding — final total only, and only when rounding is enabled (`D-65`)
- [ ] Discount subtracted **before** tax, reducing the tax base (`D-64`)
- [ ] Editing an FX rate never alters an existing quotation
- [ ] Unit tests for every formula, rounding boundary, conversion, discount, tax, additional item

---

## Module 8 — Approvals

> As a Team Leader, I want to review quotations and adjust tax and margin before approving, so that I
> protect the company's margin.

**Endpoints** `PATCH /:id/approve` · `/return` · `/edit-and-approve`

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Tax or margin edit → **mandatory audit entry** with old and new values
- [ ] Returned quotation → mandatory note + returns to Draft, appears under "Incomplete"
- [ ] Team Leader approving own quotation → `is_self_approved = true` + **yellow badge** +
      `SELF_APPROVAL` audit entry

- [ ] Team Leader and Manager → **same screen, same authority**
- [ ] No automatic escalation

---

## Module 9 — PDF Generation

> As a sales employee, I want to produce a professional PDF quotation, so that I can send it to the
> customer.

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Quotation with 3 suppliers → **no supplier name or price anywhere in the PDF**
- [ ] Generation is async on the `pdf` queue + stored against the quotation + fixed snapshot
- [ ] Generation failure → automatic retry + notification to the employee
- [ ] `show_delivery_terms = false` → that section is omitted
- [ ] CEO can **download** the existing PDF but never generate a new one
- [ ] Arabic renders correctly with embedded fonts *(proven by P-01)*
- [ ] Rendering consumes a customer-view model that **structurally cannot** contain supplier,
      cost, or margin fields
- [ ] Page numbering is dynamic — item count varies per quotation

---

## Module 10 — Customer Response & Purchase Orders

> As a sales employee, I want to record the customer's response, so that the deal moves along the
> correct path.

**Tables** `purchase_orders` — auto `po_number` + free-text `customer_po_reference` + date + attachment

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Partial or Counter → full copy saved automatically, employee edits the new version
- [ ] Counter or Rejected → **mandatory reason** before the status is accepted
- [ ] Rejected → quotation archived · **customer stays in the list** · deal becomes Lost
- [ ] `valid_until` passes with no reply → **Expired** automatically (J-01)
- [ ] Search works on both the internal PO number and the customer's reference
- [ ] Every version preserved via `parent_id` + `version`

---

## Module 11 — Procurement

> As a procurement employee, I want to renegotiate with the supplier and calculate the final profit,
> so that the company earns the best possible margin.

**Tables** `procurement_negotiations`

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Successful negotiation 1000 → 900 → saving of 100 recorded and added to final profit
- [ ] Failed negotiation → failed attempt with a reason; deal proceeds at the original price
- [ ] Procurement opening a quotation sees **cost, margin and profit**
- [ ] Delivery Complete → any of the four roles can confirm it **with attribution**

---

## Module 12 — Outdoor Visits 📱

> As an Outdoor employee, I want to record a visit outcome from my phone with minimal typing, so that
> I can finish my day quickly.

**Tables** `visits` · `visit_areas`

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Visit form has **exactly 3 mandatory fields**: company name · contact person · outcome
- [ ] Connection drops while typing → draft saved locally and not lost
- [ ] "Successful" outcome with a request → routes automatically to the Team Leader, marked "done"
- [ ] Rejection → mandatory reason, feeding the rejected-companies report
- [ ] External access unavailable (Cloudflare) → **a clear, specific message**, not a generic error (`D-59`)
- [ ] Supervisor sees visits and outdoor-scope deals, and **cannot see any deal after handover**
- [ ] Mobile-first; touch targets at least 44 × 44 px

---

## Module 13 — Reports

> As an employee, I want to submit my reports so they reach my Team Leader, so that management can
> track the work.

**Tables** `reports` · `report_recipients` · `report_versions` · **Jobs** J-04 … J-08

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Submitted report → **fixed snapshot + stored PDF**, unchanged even if the data changes

- [ ] Same type, period and employee → warning and a choice
- [ ] CEO → view, export and comment only — **no acknowledge, no return**
- [ ] Server down on the weekly report day → the job **runs on startup** (catch-up)
- [ ] No deletion — automatic archiving after six months, still viewable

---

## Module 14 — Dashboard

> As a Manager, I want to see sales and profit for a period, so that I can track performance.

**Tables** summary tables (pre-aggregation) — job J-09

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Selected period → figures match the underlying data exactly
- [ ] Two currencies → each shown separately, aggregation an optional toggle
- [ ] CEO → **no drill-down** on any figure
- [ ] Sales by Area stays behind a feature flag
- [ ] ❌ Not in MVP: Outstanding Payments · Cheques Due

---

## Module 15 — Search (Meilisearch)

> As a user, I want to search in Arabic quickly and still find results even if I misspell something.

**Implementation** swap `PostgresSearchDriver` for `MeilisearchDriver` inside `SearchService`

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Search for "احمد" finds "أحمد" (hamza normalisation)
- [ ] Minor typo still returns results (typo tolerance)
- [ ] Sales employee searches only within own customers (permission filtering)
- [ ] Meilisearch down → automatic fallback to ILIKE; **the screen does not break**

## After all modules

### End-to-end testing
- [ ] Full journey: Lead → Contacted → RFQ → supplier offer → customer quotation → approval → PDF →
      purchase order → procurement → delivery
- [ ] Parallel journey: one customer with two concurrent deals — confirm the separation holds
- [ ] **Restart test:** power the server down and back up → all services return on their own and
      missed jobs run

### Final server setup
- [ ] PostgreSQL + Redis + Meilisearch on the server
- [ ] Nginx reverse proxy + SSL
- [ ] Process manager, **enabled on boot**, correct order:
      PostgreSQL → Redis → Meilisearch → application → workers → Nginx
- [ ] `/health` endpoint reporting each service explicitly
- [ ] **Daily backups: database + files + Meilisearch — on a separate machine/disk**
- [ ] **A real restore test** — not just confirming the file exists
- [ ] **External heartbeat monitoring** (a down server cannot report itself down)
- [ ] Runbooks: restore · startup · deployment · rollback

### Pilot rollout
- [ ] Import legacy data from Excel + a session to complete incomplete records
- [ ] User training — one session per role
- [ ] **Two weeks running in parallel** with the current process before full cutover

---

## MVP success criteria

**Primary:** 80% of quotations produced in the system within one month of go-live.

| Criterion | Target | Measured from | Met |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quotations produced in the system | ≥ 80% | System count ÷ actual count | [ ] |
| Active customers registered | 100% | Review with the Team Leader | [ ] |
| Daily reports submitted | ≥ 70% of working days | Reports table | [ ] |
| Outdoor visits logged from mobile | ≥ 80% | Visits table | [ ] |
| Average quotation approval time | ≤ 1 working day | Quotation timeline | [ ] |
| Open critical bugs | Zero | Error centre | [ ] |
| Unplanned downtime | Zero | System health | [ ] |

Missing the criterion is not failure — it is a prompt to find the **cause**. The next step follows
from the cause, not from adding features.
