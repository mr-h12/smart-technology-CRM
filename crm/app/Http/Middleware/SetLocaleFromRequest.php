 * remain English; user-facing messages are localized." This middleware handles
 * the second half — the codes are never touched, only the messages built from
 * translation files.
 *
 * The header is untrusted input like any other (Coding Standards §5), so the
 * value is matched against a fixed list rather than passed to setLocale. A
 * locale that reached the framework unvalidated is a path fragment: App::setLocale
 * feeds it to the translation file loader.
